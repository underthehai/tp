* **Major Enhancements**:
    - Modified **Edit Feature** from AB3 to Wanderlust
        - What it does: The command modifies object's parameters.
        - Justifications: As a user, they need to be able to modify and update old details easily. There is a variety of parameters that
        can be edited. The command will validate parameters provided by the user according to specified type of object 
        before editing.
        - Highlights: 
            - The feature is available for all 4 different types of objects with Wanderlust (`TravelPlan`, `Activity`, `Accommodation`, `Friend`)
        - Relevant pull requests: [\#96](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/96), [\#101](https://github.com/AY2021S1-CS2103-T14-3/tp/pull/101)
        
    - Modified **Find Feature** from AB3 to Wanderlust
        - What it does: The command show a list of object whose name matches the keyword provided.
        - Justification: Within the travelplanner, the user needs to be able to find key items quickly. `Name` can help to identity specific objects. User can have an easier time finding object they are interested in.
        - Highlights: 
            - The feature is available for the 3 travelplan objects (`Activity`, `Accommodation`, `Friend`)
            - The feature will display a list of object that matches the keyword.
